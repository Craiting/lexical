lexical analyzer for python in python

### Running the lexical analyzer
To run the lexical analyzer on a python file you need to add the file in the same directory. For example
there is an file titled example.py. To run the lexical analyzer on this file, use the terminal and run
```python analyze.py``` then the program waits for a file name to be entered, so enter ```example.py```
and the output will be the lexical analysis of the python file example.py. You can analyze any python file
to get the lexical analysis.
